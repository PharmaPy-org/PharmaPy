"""
Solid-liquid separation on the MultiPhaseVessel architecture.

The legacy `SolidLiquidSep` module predates the vessel refactor: each class
there re-implements its own `Phases` setter, state declaration, solver call,
event handling and result assembly, and none of them share a base. This module
puts the ones that fit onto `MultiPhaseVessel` instead, so they inherit the
state collections, the phase/connection machinery, the controller protocol, the
event handling and every integrator backend.

Not all of them fit, and this module does not pretend otherwise:

- `Filter` is a 0-D batch unit with an explicit ODE and one terminal event. It
  is a vessel child, and its physics is unchanged from the original.
- `DeliquoringStep` is a vessel too, with its 1-D cake profile living in a
  mechanism the way the crystallizer's distribution does. It keeps the
  original's dimensionless states, because the governing equations are written
  against them, but it integrates in seconds rather than in a dimensionless
  time - the vessel has no way to be told otherwise, and the change of
  variable is one constant.
- `DisplacementWashing` has no state vector and no integration at all - it
  evaluates a closed-form `erfc` solution on a mesh. A vessel child cannot
  express that, so it will keep its own solve and merely adopt this stack's
  I/O contract. Not yet ported.

`Carousel` is not carried over: it was an 11-line stub whose only method tested
`__module__ == 'SolidLiqSep'`, a module name that has not existed for some time.

The cake correlations live in `PharmaPy.CakePhysics`, shared with the legacy
module and with `Drying_Model`.

        cruder one: it throttles the outlet whenever an inventory would not
        survive `positivity_horizon` seconds, and with the default one-second
        horizon that bites long before the event does.

    reduced concentration per species. That is what puts this model on the
    vessel at all - a unit's own states are per phase, and these are per
    depth.

    Both states are the original's dimensionless ones. Reduced saturation is
